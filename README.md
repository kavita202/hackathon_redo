# Hackathon_redo #Week_2

## School of Code Hackathon
### Hackathon brief: 
1. Fetch the data using API
2. Look at the format of the data and decide how we are going to use it
3. Use the dom/html to format our page
4. Make the page responsive
5. Format our page using CSS
6. Add differently functionality - choice of difficulty, number of questions

## Outcome
In a group of 3, we worked on using Fetch to retrive questions from a trivia database.<br>
[Original code](https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/w2d5_hackathon-fetch-kavita)

Additional functionality allows user to select the difficulty of their questions and styling using CSS.<br>
Vanilla JS used to collate results and give feedback on each question<br>
Styled using a google forms layout color palette from the original trivia game<br>
